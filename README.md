# Image Steganography
 Image Steganography is the process of hiding information which can be text, image or video inside a cover image. The secret information is hidden in a way that it not visible to the human eyes. 
 In this project user needs to run the project. The user has two tab options – encode and decode.
If the user selects encode, the application gives the screen to select the image file, information file and option to save the image file. If the user selects decode, the application gives the screen to select only the image file and ask the path where the user wants to save the secrete file.
 This project has two methods – Encryption and Decryption. In encryption, the secret information
is hiding in with any type of image file. Decryption is getting the secret information from the image file.
